## About

This is a game I created from scratch in 72 hours for the [130th Mini Jam](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-130-lunar). I participated in this jam through my Video Game Development course at Missouri State University. The game was published Sunday, April 16, 2023.

## Description

Tiny puzzle adventure set on the moon, made for Mini Jam 130: Lunar.

Find your home planet and launch in 10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...

## Software

For graphics, I used a combination of [JSPaint](https://jspaint.app/#local:7d385bb4f0b0c) and [Piskel.](https://www.piskelapp.com/)

The environment I used is Visual Studio Code.

I used the following libraries
* lime
* openfl 
* flixel
* flixel-addons

All coding was done in Haxe.
